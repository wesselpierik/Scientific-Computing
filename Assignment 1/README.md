# Assignment 1
## Structure:
- src/: Source python files:
  - src/assignment1-2.py: Logic and Plotting for time dependent diffusion.
  - src/assignment1-3.py: Plotting functionality for time independent diffusion
  - src/time_independent.py: Logic for the time independent diffusion grid, including the Jacobi, Gauss-Seidel and SOR iteration.
- Team_effort_distribution_template.docx: The team effort distribution, including the results of git-fame.

## Examples
### Time Dependent Diffusion
The assignments D to F can be run by calling:
```bash
python src/assignment1-2.py <option>
```
Here the option is either *animated*, *tolerance* or *plot_timesteps* for the generation of the plots  in the report and the animation showing the time evolution of the system.
### Time Independent Diffusion
The assignments H to L can be run by calling:
```bash
python src/assignment1-3.py <option>
```
, where the option is the character defining the assignment.
